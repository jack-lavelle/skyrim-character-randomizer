# skyrim-character-randomizer
[Temporary ReadMe ... Updated 10/17/22]

There will be multiple versions of this project. The first is to just get a very simple and easy to use randomizer that can be copy and pasted into an online
python console (like this one: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/).

From here I will add more advanced options for randomization and more kinds of builds that incorporate roleplaying challenges and other specifics to make a
playthrough more interesting.

Eventually I will make a website so that it is much easier to use.
